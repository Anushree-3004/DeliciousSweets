feat: Add separate Search page for filtering sweets

- Create new Search.jsx page component with search/filter functionality
- Add /sweets/search route in App.jsx
- Add Search link to Navbar (visible when authenticated)
- Remove search functionality from Dashboard page
- Dashboard now only displays all sweets without filters
